				I was born and raised in Federal Way Washington, where I developed a strong interest in technology from a young age. 
				My fascination with computers and problem-solving led me to pursue a career in computer science. 
				I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Washington Tacoma in 2016, 
				and later went on to complete a Master’s degree in Computer Science with a focus on Cyber-Physical Systems at the 
				University of Washington in 2018. <br/>
				My professional journey began at NAVSEA-NUWC-Keyport, where I worked as a Computer Scientist from 2016 to 2019. 
				During this time, I honed my skills in software development, system architecture, and data communication, 
				contributing to a variety of defense-related projects. In 2019, I transitioned to NAVSEA-NSWCCD-Bangor Detachment, 
				where I have continued to expand my expertise in system optimization and cross-functional collaboration, 
				working on mission-critical systems that require innovative technical solutions.<br/>
				In my work, I regularly apply my knowledge of computer system architecture, data communication protocols, 
				and system software organization, ensuring that the systems I design and maintain meet the highest standards 
				of performance and reliability. I also enjoy collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to solve complex technical 
				challenges and create scalable, efficient systems.</p>
				<p><span></span>
				Outside of work, I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in technology and enjoy engaging 
				in personal coding projects, which often help me refine my skills. In my spare time, I enjoy board games, paddle boarding, 
				traveling and exploring new ways to apply my technical expertise to solve everyday problems.</p>
